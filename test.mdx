## Build a Beautiful Waitlist App + Admin Using Only Prompts

This blog gives you clean, copy-ready prompts to generate an entire Waitlist app (frontend + backend) and an Admin panel using your IDE assistant. No code snippets here—just actionable prompts. No MCP required.

### 1) Initialize the Project

```text
Create a new Next.js project named "waitlist-pro" with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, and ESLint. Set up a modern base layout with a dark gradient background, clean typography, and import global Tailwind styles. Ensure the home page renders successfully.
```

### 2) Environment Variables

```text
Add a .env.local with:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID=
- PICA_SECRET_KEY=
- PICA_GMAIL_CONNECTION_KEY=

Add a short README section showing where to get the values:
- Pica API keys: https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys
- Pica Gmail connection: https://app.picaos.com/connections

Validate that env variables are loaded in development.
```

### 3) InstantDB Client and Schema

```text
Create an InstantDB client in lib/db.ts using @instantdb/react and @instantdb/core. Define a `signups` entity with fields: name (string), email (string), interest (optional string), status (string: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'notified'), welcomeEmailSent (boolean), createdAt (date). Export the initialized client and schema type. Ensure type safety and that it compiles.
```

### 4) Email API Route (Pica Gmail)

```text
Create an App Router API route at app/api/send-welcome-email/route.ts. It accepts JSON { name, email, signupId }, constructs a polished HTML welcome email, builds a RFC 5322 MIME message (text/html), encodes it as base64url, and sends via Pica Gmail passthrough (POST https://api.picaos.com/v1/passthrough/users/me/messages) using headers: x-pica-secret, x-pica-connection-key, x-pica-action-id. Return JSON success or error.
```

### 5) Attractive Waitlist Form UI

```text
Design a beautiful client form in app/page.tsx with fields: name, email, interest (select with early-access, pricing, features, updates). Style with a glassy/gradient card. On submit:
1) Create a `signups` record in InstantDB with status 'pending' and welcomeEmailSent false
2) Call /api/send-welcome-email with { name, email, signupId }
3) On success, set status 'notified' and welcomeEmailSent true
Show loading, success, and error states; reset form on success; ensure accessibility.
```

### 6) UX Polish and Metrics

```text
Add a simple success toast (or inline success message) and a signup counter sourced from InstantDB. Ensure mobile responsiveness, keyboard accessibility, and focus management for errors.
```

### 7) Admin Panel (Dashboard)

```text
Create an admin page at app/admin/page.tsx and a dashboard component. Display a table of signups with columns: name, email, interest, status, createdAt. Add a status filter (all | pending | notified | confirmed). Provide per-row actions to set status to 'confirmed' or back to 'pending' using InstantDB; implement optimistic updates and graceful error recovery.
```

### 8) Admin API Endpoints

```text
Add routes:
1) GET app/api/signups → returns list of signups (support ?status=)
2) POST app/api/signups/[id]/status → body { status: 'pending' | 'notified' | 'confirmed' }
Validate inputs, return JSON responses, handle errors cleanly, and ensure no secrets are exposed to the client.
```

### 9) Documentation & Deployment Readiness

```text
Update README with setup steps, environment variables, and links for Pica API keys and Gmail connection:
- https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys
- https://app.picaos.com/connections

Add a troubleshooting section for common Pica/InstantDB issues. Confirm production build succeeds and routes compile.
```

### 10) QA Scenarios

```text
Test plan:
1) Submit the form with valid inputs → success message appears
2) Confirm a signup record is created; email is sent; status updates to 'notified'
3) Visit /admin → filter by status and verify the new record appears
4) Change status to 'confirmed' → verify persistence after reload
5) Validate envs: missing keys produce clear errors
```
